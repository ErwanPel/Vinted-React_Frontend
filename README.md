## Overview

This replica of Vinted is the guiding thread project carried out during the "Le RÃ©acteur" bootcamp. It allows you to understand the basic structure of an e-commerce site, from the creation of a user to the presentation of offers and payment.

This client-side Vinted project uses 8 pages:

1) HomePage: Displays a list of offers limited to 20 products per page. A pagination system allows you to change pages.
2) OfferPage: Displays an offer page with all the information and associated photos. If the offer belongs to the logged-in user who published it, he can delete or modify it.
3) SignPage: Displays the registration form.
4) LoginPage: Displays the login form.
5) PublishPage: Displays a form for entering information and at least one photo to publish an offer. The number of photos is limited to 6 per offer. Access to this page requires a valid login.
6) PaymentPage: Displays product information and credit card details. Access to this page requires a valid login.
7) BuyPage: Displays the user's purchases. Access to this page requires a valid login.
8) SoldPage: Displays the user's sales. Access to this page requires a valid login.

The header allows users to filter their search by product name, ascending or descending price, or price range.
